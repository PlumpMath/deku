 - Progressing well so far
 - Placeholder code may be gotten rid of at demo/final product if not reached within time (ex. messages)
 - All features from initial SRS may not be reached by demo/final product
    - Shawn says this is okay. Make sure to get the complete basics down. Things like messages can try to get done but  not absolutely mandatory
 - Goals for Spiral 3 Demo/Final Product - add features, clean up
