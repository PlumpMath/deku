Section-2-Team-6 Repository

If you're adding code, please look at the wiki first.

Some guidelines:

* Don't push your development environment to the repo.
* If you start using a new Python library, add it to requirements.txt. Try to be
  specific about versioning.
* To test this out, clone the repo and call `./run.py`.
